            Food is essential for survival. Everyone has their own personal choice of a favourite food. Who doesn’t love eating food? Almost everyone does. As a matter of fact, 
            food forms a great part of our culture and is not just limited to sustenance purposes only. Different cultures have their own unique variety of food and dishes. 
            Eating food not just satisfies one’s tummy but also provides the necessary nutrients for consumption. However, eating proper food during the growing years enhances the overall development. 
            It boosts metabolism and provides energy when all the nutrients are consumed in proper quantities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.
            Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone.

        <h4>Healthy Food & Tips</h4>
        <P>
            Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. Dairy recommendations include low-fat or fat-free milk, lactose-free milk, and fortified soy beverages. 
            Other plant-based beverages do not have the same nutritional properties as animal’s milk and soy beverages. Protein recommendations include <code>seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans, peas, and lentils), 
            soy products, nuts, and seeds.</code>
        </P>
        <h5>What you eat matters</h5>
        <P>
            Research shows the food and beverages people consume can have a significant impact on their health and well-being, and it all begins in the gut.
        </P>
        <h6>What conctitute to a healthy gut?</h6>
        <P>
            A healthy gut microbiome relies on the richness and diversity of the bacteria present. 
            Having a wider array of microbes in the gut creates a healthier and more resilient environment, whereas symptoms of an unhealthy gut tend to present themselves when a lack of diversity and balance exists. 
            Research shows that while genetics are a factor, diet has emerged as having substantially more of an impact on the inner workings of your gut, so what you eat truly matters.

        <h3>Key Nutrients During Adolecents</h3>
        <h4><code>Iron</code></h4>
        <p>
            Iron is essential for teenager’s health due to it being a period of fast growth and development.
            It is especially important for teenage girls as they start menstruating.Iron can be found in animal sources (meat and fish) and plant sources (wholegrain cereals, dark green leafy vegetables, pulses and dried fruits).
            Your body absorbs iron from meat and fish more easily than from vegetables. 
            However if your child does not eat meat or fish they can still get enough iron from foods such as fortified breakfast cereals, pulses and dark green leafy vegetables.
            It is important to have some foods or drinks containing vitamin C when eating iron rich vegetable sources as this helps with the absorption of iron.
        </p>
        <h4><code>Calcium</code></h4>
        <p>
            Calcium is important for healthy bones and teeth as well as the function of muscles and nerves.

                <li>girls: 800mg </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Foods containing calcium include:

            It plays a key role in many of our body's functions, including bringing nutrients to cells, getting rid of wastes, protecting joints and organs, and maintaining body temperature.
